HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It is used on the frontend and gives the structure to the webpage which
you can style using CSS and make interactive using JavaScript.

WIKIPEDIA definition of HyperText:
Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices
with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access.
Hypertext documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically
activated by a mouse click, keypress set, or screen touch.
Apart from text, the term "hypertext" is also sometimes used to describe
tables, images, and other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks.
Hypertext is one of the key underlying concepts of the World Wide Web,
where Web pages are often written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
As implemented on the Web, hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication
of information over the Internet.


What is HTML element?
An HTML element is defined by a start Tag, Some Content and an end tag.
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
e.g. <h1>My First Heading</h1>
     <p>My first paragraph.</p>

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element).
These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to
read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display
the document
Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser.
The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar
or in the page's tab.
